# NodeSchool Montreal

**NodeSchool** is open source workshops that teach web software skills: [http://nodeschool/montreal](http://nodeschool.io/montreal/)

You are encouraged to do the [workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) on your own or in person at a NodeSchool event. The workshopper tutorials are used as the course curriculum while mentors help attendees work through challenges.
